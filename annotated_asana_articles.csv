If a task is no longer relevant or is too noisy due to frequent updates, a collaborator can click the bell icon in the bottom-right corner of the task pane and select Leave task. They won't receive inbox notifications about the task anymore. You can also @mention other tasks, projects, portfolios, and goals in your comments and task descriptions.

https://help.asana.com/hc/en-us/articles/20160154656923-Create-tasks-in-Asana,Likes and appreciations,"What are likes for? Likes don't have a concrete meaning, but are often used to signal your approval or quickly let someone know you've read their update. You can like tasks, comments, and even the fact that someone has completed a task. Likes are a great way to say “I've seen this,” “I like this,” “Good job,” or “I agree” without having to type anything at all. You can even conduct a simple poll by asking colleagues to vote on different tasks in your project - the more likes, the more votes. Appreciations are another way to celebrate a win or make a big deal about a significant update. Getting a big chunk of work over the line might call for a surfing yeti, or you might choose to celebrate someone's achievement with a narwhal jumping through a hoop. Choose from twelve different animations by clicking the Appreciations button in the comment toolbar.",0,860
https://help.asana.com/hc/en-us/articles/20160154656923-Create-tasks-in-Asana,What does collaboration look like in Asana?,"If you're a collaborator on a task, you will receive updates about that task in your Asana Inbox. Some tasks only require passive collaboration, like keeping an eye on how work is progressing by receiving updates when custom field values change, or reading stakeholder comments as they discuss their next move. Some tasks will require more active collaboration, where you'll need to write comments, @mention colleagues and other tasks, update the task description, change the task's due date, and maybe even the assignee. While you're taking action inside the task, your collaborators receive updates about your actions in their inbox - just as you receive them when someone else moves the work forward.",0,703

If you think the work is done, complete the task; the task can be reopened if more work is necessary. Completing a task doesn't delete the task or remove it from your project. Depending on how the project filters are set, a completed task might not appear for you anymore, but it's easy to find it again if needed. Set your filter to Completed tasks or remove the filter altogether, and you'll see completed tasks again. Task collaborators will receive an inbox notification when you complete a task. They might like the notification, send you an appreciation or a comment, or if they think there's more to cover, they can reopen the task by clicking ✓ Completed in the task pane.",0,720

You can pull the most important information from emails, documents, and other applications into your Asana tasks and projects where you can most effectively collaborate on the work to be done.

Use the Gmail or Outlook integrations to create clear, actionable tasks in Asana without leaving your inbox. Communication isn't restricted to email, of course. Many teams use different tools like MS Teams and Power BI from Microsoft or Google Drive and Looker from Google throughout their day.
